# MOVI-schematic
Reverse-engineered Schematic for Audeme MOVI Arduino Shield

## Status
This schematic is reverse engineered from the MOVI Arduino Shield without the assistance of
X-ray or destructive tear-down. It is likely incomplete and inaccurate.
There is no PCB layout included.

This work was done as an exercise in using KiCad's schematic capture capabilities.
The main goal was to learn KiCad and better understand the MOVI hardware.  
The result of these two goals is:
* I put a strong focus on fitting everything on a single page.
* There are likely to be significant design failures that prevent this schematic from
  being useful for creating a PCB layout.

The MOVI silkscreen includes very few component designations so I made most of these up arbitrarily.  
There are a few images included in the project that are annotated to show where each component is.
* [top.xcf](top.xcf)
* [bottom.xcf](bottom.xcf)  
You can open these files with GIMP.

## License
As far as I am concerned you may use this schematic for any purpose.
I do not in any way warrant its accuracy, correctness, or suitability for any purpose.

Audeme claims non-specified intellectual property rights. These possibly include,
but are not limited to, rights under issued and pending patents, mask work rights,
copyright rights, trademark rights and trade secret rights.

It is my good-faith belief that I have not violated any of these rights by posting my
interpretation of the device schematic here. However, any reproduction of the device,
even one based on this schematic, would likely violate one or more of the above rights.
